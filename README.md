> **A modern, modular, and powerful Discord moderation & security bot built with Discord.js v14.**

Axiora is designed to provide everything a Discord community needs—from moderation and security to automation and server management. The project is built with scalability in mind, allowing new systems to be added without changing the core architecture.
